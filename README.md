2. Functional Requirements
User Input

A form for the user to enter a movie title.

A submit button to trigger recommendations.

Recommendation Engine

Load movie dataset from a CSV file (e.g., movies.csv).

Show a list of recommended movies in a table or card layout (Bootstrap styling).

Include movie title and rating.

Error Handling

If the entered movie does not exist, show a ‚ÄúMovie not found‚Äù message.
